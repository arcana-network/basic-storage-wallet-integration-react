# Sample Code: Basic Storage and Auth SDK Integration (React)

The repository `basic-storage-wallet-integration` contains sample code to demonstrate how you can integrate [React JavaScript Framework](https://reactjs.org/) UI application with Arcana [Auth](https://github.com/arcana-network/auth) and [Storage](https://github.com/arcana-network/storage) SDKs.

It does not have any code for invoking other features and functions of these integrated SDKs.  Check out Arcana [Sample Demo App](https://github.com/arcana-network/demo-app) repository for a full fledged sample dApp that integrates with Arcana SDKs and plugs in Auth and Storage functionalities.

This repository is bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Download Software Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

You can run the sample application in the development mode.

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view\
it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Launch Test Runner

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode run the following script:

```bash
npm test
```

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Production Build

To compile and minify for production build, use this script:

 ```bash
 npm run build
 ```

This script builds the application for production in to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Using Custom Configuration

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## üìö Usage

You can utilize the source code in this repository for getting started with Arcana Network SDKs. Use it to build a stand alone basic React application that integrates with the latest Auth and Storage SDK.  You may plug in additional functionality and try out various features of the SDKs.

See [Arcana Documentation](https://docs.beta.arcana.network/) for user guides and SDK Reference Guides.  

To get started with Arcana SDKs quickly, you can also check out other [code samples and templates](https://docs.beta.arcana.network/docs/overview_cs) in the `Developer Resources` section of the documentation.
